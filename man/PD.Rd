\usage{
PD(v, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{v is number of genotypes}

}
\value{
This function generates polycross designs using various methods for a given number of genotypes (v).
}
\description{
This package contains function for generating polycross designs using nine methods available in literature.

type1: v(>2) such that (v+1) is a prime number;

type1 is a series of polycross designs generated using the method given by Olesen and Olesen (1973).

type2: v (>2) is taken such that (v+1) is a prime number;

type2 is a series of completely balanced polycross designs generated using the method given by Olesen (1976).

type3: v(>2) is any integer;

type3 is a series of polycross designs with complete neighbour balance generated using the method given by Morgan (1988).

type4: v=5,7,9 or 11.

type4 is a series of balanced polycross designs given by Morgan(1988).

type5: v (>2) is taken in such a way that (v+1) is a prime number;

type5 is a series of Neighbour-balanced polycross designs for v genotypes (where v+1 is prime) for polycross trials as given in Varghese et al. (2015).

type6: v (>4) is any odd number;

type6 is a series of Neighbour-balanced polycross designs for v genotypes (where v is an odd number) for polycross trials as given in Varghese et al. (2015).

type7: v(>2)= 2*m, where, m is an odd positive integer;

type7 is a series of Neighbour-restricted block designs for polycross trials as given in Varghese et al. (2015).

type8: v = 4*m, where m is any positive integer;

type8 is a series of Neighbour-restricted rowâ€“column designs for polycross trials as given in Varghese et al. (2015).

type9: v is a prime number but (v-1) should be a multiple of 3;

type9 is a series of Polycross designs for directional wind system for polycross trials as given in Varghese et al. (2015).
